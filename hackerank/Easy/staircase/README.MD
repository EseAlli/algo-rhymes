# Question

 ## Explanation
My solution here is in Javascript and its pretty straightforward and follows a similar approach. The question has a number of N stairs and Its base and height are both equal to N. It is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces. 


Firstly, in the context of this question, there is a total number of N stairs and we are required to print as much space for each line till we get to the last line.

By default, we would want to have a loop to run through N numbers and ensure we add the required space (N -1) before adding the harsh(#) character. Simple enough right. I though so too.
